# Compliance Notes

## Overview
This document summarizes how the current front-end Tic Tac Toe implementation aligns with data integrity concepts inspired by ALCOA+ and clarifies the explicit limits of compliance in a purely client-side application. It also outlines a potential path to advance toward stronger compliance in a full-stack context.

## ALCOA+ Mapping in the Current Front-End
- Attributable: Each audit entry includes userId (Player X/O) and a stable sessionId, enabling within-session traceability. In a full system, userId would originate from an authenticated identity provider.
- Legible: Code is structured and commented. Public interfaces are annotated with PUBLIC_INTERFACE comments for clarity. Tests explain expected behavior.
- Contemporaneous: Actions are logged at the time they occur via logAction() and emitted to the console immediately.
- Original: The front-end maintains an in-memory audit sequence that reflects original interactions during the session. Without persistence, provenance is limited to the current session.
- Accurate: Input validations (validators.ts) enforce correct indices, player values, and empty-cell constraints. Game logic is deterministic and covered by unit tests to ensure correctness.
- Complete: Audit entries capture timestamps, userId, sessionId, action, before/after state, and optional payload. Within the front-end’s scope, this is comprehensive.
- Consistent: All state transitions are funneled through validated pure functions; the app dispatches audit entries uniformly for PLAY/UNDO/RESET/ERROR.
- Enduring: Not satisfied in full. Data is not persisted beyond the browser session. There is no server-side retention or backup.
- Available: Not satisfied in full. There is no authentication, authorization, or controlled access to the audit trail. Console logs are visible to any user on the device.

## Explicit Scope Limits
- No persistence: Audit trail is in-memory and lost on refresh or close. There is no database or durable storage.
- No authentication or roles: There is no concept of user accounts, roles, or access controls. The “userId” is simply the current player mark (“X”/“O”).
- No electronic signatures: There are no signature capture mechanisms or identity verification steps, and no binding of signatures to data.
- No server-side safeguards: There are no server-side logs, retention policies, or encryption, and no segregation of duties.

These limits mean that while the app demonstrates several ALCOA+ principles on the client, it does not constitute a compliant system by itself.

## Recommended Path to Stronger Compliance
To evolve this demonstration toward a system that more fully aligns with ALCOA+ and typical GxP expectations, consider:
1. Authentication and Identity
   - Integrate secure authentication (e.g., OIDC) to obtain verified user identity for audit entries.
   - Store user identifiers and permissions securely.
2. Durable, Versioned Audit Storage
   - Persist audit logs to a server-side store with append-only semantics, retention policies, and backups.
   - Include integrity protections (hash chaining, digital signatures) and tamper-evident mechanisms.
3. Access Controls and Authorization
   - Implement role-based permissions for actions (e.g., play, undo, reset) as appropriate to the domain.
   - Enforce least privilege and log access attempts.
4. Electronic Signatures for Critical Operations
   - Add explicit signature capture with user re-authentication for critical actions.
   - Bind signatures to the specific data and store them durably.
5. Validation and Testing Expansion
   - Extend automated tests to cover authentication flows, authorization checks, server APIs, and audit persistence.
   - Add performance tests and reliability checks for audit logging throughput and retention.
6. Operational Controls
   - Add monitoring, alerting, and audit review workflows.
   - Document SOPs for handling audit records, incident response, and change control.

## Current Acceptance Criteria Coverage Highlights
- Winning-line highlight and non-color cues: Implemented in Board/Square with aria-describedby and an icon; tested in Board.test.tsx and App.integration.test.tsx.
- Keyboard navigation: Implemented with roving tabindex and key handling; tested in Board.test.tsx and App.integration.test.tsx.
- Audit trail with sessionId: Implemented in utils/audit.ts and integrated in App handlers; tested in audit.test.ts and App.integration.test.tsx.

## Conclusion
The current front-end application demonstrates many good practices and provides a clear foundation for ALCOA+-inspired behaviors within its limited scope. Achieving end-to-end compliance requires a back-end that provides authenticated identity, durable storage, access controls, and operational governance.
